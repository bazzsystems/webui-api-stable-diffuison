This is a web page that allows users to generate AI-generated images based on a given prompt. The page has several input fields where the user can specify the prompt, 

image dimensions, and other parameters. When the user clicks the "Generate Image" button, an HTTP request is sent to an API endpoint, which returns a base64-encoded 

image. The image is then displayed on the page, along with its decoded version. The page also includes a warning that only one image can be generated per 60 seconds and a 

link to a Discord server.
